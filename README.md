## Scope of Work
Does your brilliant billion dollar idea compile into a sustainable business? Do you really need this funding now? 
Hmm, let's speak on facts... We are in 2049 and you are building a Spacecraft. 
How a viable business plan might look like?

### Summary

Dummy-D offers the most relaxing space traveling experience around the globe. Our Spacecrafts are developed to make travelers feel like home providing one of a kind features such as internet, sofas on-board and jacuzzi. We've been working on our product for a year now, using our own capital and are currently searching 40.000.000 drachmas to make the business roll. We already have some customer attention, manifested via pre-booked tickets; however, success is calculated on fully deposited bookings, starting from 1st January 2050.

### Team

We met each other 10 years ago at the university. Our goal is to create a modern company where any professional would love to work.

| Jen      | Business Operations, Sales and Design.|

#### b. Legal

##### Shareholding

| Jen      |   50%  |

### Market

Our Market is constantly growing since the first trip back in 2020. By 2048 the need of our product became clear, with more than 1.000.000 customers traveling around the universe.

#### a. Geotargeting

More than half of space travelers are Africans with ~50% of them being Malawians. According to the African Space Institution, the average African citizen spends more than 100k drachmas per year for travel, with more than 50% of this amount going to space traveling. Later on, Latin American and Chinese markets will also be targeted.

##### Expansion Map

| China           |         |         |         |  :key:  |

#### b. Competition

|                 | Comfort | Security |  Price  | Total   |
|-----------------|:-------:|:--------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| Dummy-D         |    5    |    5     |    3    |   13    |
| Space-X         |    4    |    5     |    4    |   13    |
| Laika           |    3    |    5     |    5    |   13    |

On one hand Dummy-D outperforms competitive players by being far more comforting. On the other hand, ticket price is higher than the market average as relaxation services addition results to higher production costs. As the totals reveal, we enter the market offering an equivalent to traditional market leaders product.

### Product

Dummy-D is currently in version 0.9-Sofa. Jacuzzi feature is in the building and will be introduced in version 1.0. The maximum capacity of our aircraft is 75 travelers/journey.
